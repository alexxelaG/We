# **We :) — Sports Friendship & Matching App**

We :) is a **sports-focused, friendship-first** web application designed to connect people through shared athletic interests. Instead of traditional social or dating platforms, We :) helps users meet compatible sports partners, join groups, schedule games, and build real, platonic friendships.

This project is built as part of **CS-152** at **San José State University**.
